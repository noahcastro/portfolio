<h3>Princess Mononoke Art</h3>
	<img src="./resources/images/princess mononoke.jpg">
<p> This design was for a project I did in high school where the assignment was to create art for a movie we had watched recently, and Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke was a movie I had watched in my film class the week before. Perfect timing!</p>

<h4> Lady Gaga - Artpop</h4>
<img src="./resources/images/artpop.png">
<p> This is one of my designs for a pin I made last year. ARTPOP was a really imapactful album for me and my life so I wanted to commemorate that in a pin. I was really happy with the way it came out!</p>

<h5> Lady Gaga - The Fame Monster </h5>
<img src="./resources/images/famemonster.png">
<p> This was my very first design I made for my pins and I was so happy with how they came out. This design is inspired from Lady Gaga's second album, The Fame Monster.</p>
